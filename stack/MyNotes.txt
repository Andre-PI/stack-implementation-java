
All the primitive datas are a Object class data, that's why it's better to use this instead any other specific primitive data.

"Node" is a location in the memory

this.top refers to the last data added, stacks are data structures that the last-in first-out, so this.top is what we need to use to get to point to the next node.

In stacks pop() don't have any params because we just "remove" the data in the top and can't choose what data is removed.
